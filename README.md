# WordGameSolver
C# Event Driven Final Project

C# Windows Forms App to help in word games 

First tab is for games in which you are given specific letters to form a word.

Second tab is for Wordle, where you have to guess the daily five letter word. 

  After each guess, green indicates you guessed the correct letter in the right position, yellow indicates the letter is somewhere in the word,
  and grey means that the letter is not in the word.
  
  Replicating this in the WordHelper App outputs the possible five letter words that satisfy the known conditions.
  
 
 Third tab utilizes Databases, in which words may be added or removed from the dictionary. (Database is not remote access enabled)
 
  Words in the Database dictionary txtbox could appear in the potential words box if the word conditions are satisfied. 
  
  Words in the Removed Words txtbox will never appead in the potential words box even if they are in the dictionary.
